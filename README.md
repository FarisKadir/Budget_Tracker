## Description

I created this application to allow a user to track their withdrawals and deposits, even while offline. A user can add or subtract funds. A graph will display any new entries. When a user is offline, any transactions that they add will be stored and then sent to the database when back online.

## User_Story
```
AS AN avid traveller I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
```
