## Description

I created this application to allow a user to track their withdrawals and deposits, even while offline. A user can create a new workout, then add exercises that they completed to the workout. It can also display the statistics of the workouts.

## User_Story
```
AS AN avid traveller I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
